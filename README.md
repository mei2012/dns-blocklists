### :books: **Multi - Cleans the Internet and protects your privacy!** <a name="overview"></a>

An all-in-one DNS blocklist in **various versions (light, normal, pro, pro++ and ultimate)**. It can be used as a standalone blocklist. For every region. Blocks ads, affiliate, tracking, metrics, telemetry, fake, phishing, malware, scam, cryptojacking and other "crap". Based on [various blocklists](sources.md). No, they are not just block lists cobbled together from different sources. They have been optimized and extended to efficiently "clean the Internet" in all areas.             

See also: [Which sources are used for the lists and how are the lists compiled on the basis of these sources?](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/wiki/FAQ#sources)

### :green_book: **Multi LIGHT** - **Basic protection** <a name="light"></a>

Hand brush - Cleans the Internet and protects your privacy! Blocks Ads, Tracking, Metrics and some Badware. A size-optimized version of the Multi NORMAL.

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocking type:** Relaxed              
> This list version should not lead to any restrictions. It is particularly suitable for environments in which there is no admin nearby who can unblock something and if you have to pay attention to the size of the list, because the AdBlocker does not support large lists.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Does not block error trackers such as Bugsnag, Crashlytics, Firebase, Instabug, Sentry, ... and other app-specific crash trackers. These are only blocked from the Pro version onwards.

### :ledger: **Multi PRO** - **Extended protection (Recommended)** <a name="pro"></a>

Big broom - Cleans the Internet and protects your privacy! Blocks Ads, Affiliate, Tracking, Metrics, Telemetry, Phishing, Malware, Scam, Fake, Cryptojacking and other "Crap".

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocking type:** Balanced            
> This list version should only very rarely lead to restrictions. It is suitable for environments where there is an admin nearby who can unblock something. My personal recommendation for mostly problem-free adblocking with good privacy protection.

Sweeper - Aggressive cleans the Internet and protects your privacy! Blocks Ads, Affiliate, Tracking, Metrics, Telemetry, Phishing, Malware, Scam, Fake, Cryptojacking and other "Crap".

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocking type:** Balanced/Aggressive              
> More aggressive version of the Multi PRO blocklist. It may contain a few false positive domains that limit functionality. Therefore it should only be used by experienced users. Furthermore, an admin should be available to unblock incorrectly blocked domains.

> [!WARNING]
> **Referral domains (affiliate and tracking links):**           
> A few referral domains that also function as normal trackers are blocked. For further details see: [Referral domains](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/wiki/FAQ#referral)

### :closed_book: **Multi ULTIMATE** - **Aggressive protection** <a name="ultimate"></a>

Ultimate Sweeper - Strictly cleans the Internet and protects your privacy! Blocks Ads, Affiliate, Tracking, Metrics, Telemetry, Phishing, Malware, Scam, Free Hoster, Fake, Cryptojacking and other "Crap".

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocking type:** Aggressive              
> Stricter version of the Multi PRO++ blocklist. It contains domains that limit functionality in apps and on websites - some popular trackers, that lead to restrictions, are blocked in this list. Therefore it should only be used by experienced users. Furthermore, an admin should be available to unblock incorrectly blocked domains.       

> [!WARNING]
> **Referral domains (affiliate and tracking links):**           
> A few referral domains that also function as normal trackers are blocked. For further details see: [Referral domains](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/wiki/FAQ#referral)
>                   
> **Facebook:**          
> Some META trackers are blocked in Ultimate. This restricts the use of Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps. Furthermore, the Whatsapp graph trackers are blocked, which leads to restrictions when creating avatars, using the in-app helpcenter and using video effects. Otherwise, blocking has no effect on Whatsapp functionalities. To use META apps with Ultimate, unblock the following domains if necessary: [META Tracker](share/facebook.txt)
>           
> **Windows/XBox:**          
> Some Microsoft trackers are blocked in Ultimate, which lead to restrictions, e.g. Windows Spotlight, XBox Live Achievements Activity History and others. For details and which domains must be unblocked for which function, see: [Microsoft Tracker](share/microsoft.txt).

#### :closed_lock_with_key: **Threat Intelligence Feeds - IPs** <a name="tifips"></a>

IPv4 lists in [plain IP format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/ips/tif.txt) for firewalls and [AdGuard Home format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/tif-ips.txt) are also available as an extension to the TIF list.

> [!TIP]
> If the IP list is used in AdGuard Home, all domains that would resolve to the blocked IP are blocked. To prevent the blocked domains from being resolved via IPv6, it is necessary to deactivate resolving via IPv6 in AdGuard Home:

### :crystal_ball: **Most Abused TLDs - Protects against known malicious Top Level Domains! (Recommended)** <a name="tlds"></a>

A blocklist for blocking Top Most Abused Top Level Domains, merged from [@Yokoffing](https://github.com/yokoffing), [@DandelionSprout](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/), [@LennyFox](https://github.com/lennyfox) Cloudflare Radar, Netcraft and SpamHaus.

> [!WARNING]
> The Most Abused TLDs list is designed to block entire top-level domains (such as *.top, *.shop, *.gdn) with poor reputations. While this may also block some legitimate sites, it is highly effective at preventing spam, scams, phishing, malware, and other malicious content. Users should be aware of which sites are affected by this list.
>
> Only widely-used, reputable domains—such as those appearing on major top lists (Umbrella, Cloudflare, Tranco, Chrome, DomCop, etc.) or those essential for popular apps and services—will be considered for exclusion. Illegal domains, including those related to piracy, will not be unblocked. Domains that do not meet these criteria are reviewed individually; if exclusion is not justified, they remain blocked. Users who need access to such domains should add them to their personal allowlist.
>
> This selective approach is necessary because AdGuard and uBlock Origin have technical limits on rule length when using denyallow/domain modifiers. Attempting to exclude every legitimate domain would eventually break important rules, so exclusions must be limited and carefully chosen.

> - Pro++ (Aggressive): This list blocks additional native trackers that may cause some restrictions or limit certain features.
> - Ultimate: This list provides the most comprehensive blocking, including all native trackers for maximum privacy.
>           
> By choosing a specific list version, you can control how aggressively native trackers are blocked according to your preferences.
>               
> When combining native tracker lists with standard lists, you may need to manually unblock certain native trackers as required.

### :bulb: **Recommendation** <a name="recommendation"></a>

As a network-wide DNS blocker, I recommend using [Adguard Home](https://adguard.com), [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), [TechnitiumDNS](https://technitium.com/dns/), [Blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky) (advanced users), [adblock-lean](https://github.com/lynxthecat/adblock-lean) (OpenWrt) or [eBlocker](https://eblocker.org/).

DNS blockers offer good protection of privacy by blocking tracking, metrics and telemetry. They can be used to block the vast majority of ads, malware, scam, fake and co, but not everything can be blocked at the DNS level!
Therefore, I **additionally** recommend the use of a browser content blocker such as [AdGuard](https://adguard.com), [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com) or [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/).

Check out Yokoffing's [Recommended Filters for uBlock Origin](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists) for content blocker filter lists.

The blocklists are based on [various sources](sources.md) and my own denylists/extensions. They were designed to avoid false positive domains as much as possible without losing effectiveness and efficiency. Dead hosts are regularly removed from the lists to keep them as small as possible.
Made with :heartbeat: for a safer and cleaner internet.

All lists were tested against 10000 websites from the Cisco Umbrella Top 1 million list. It was checked whether the pages load, the page content is displayed correctly, navigation links work, images load, videos start and much more.

No, they are not just block lists cobbled together from different sources. They have been optimized and extended to efficiently "clean the Internet" in all areas. See also: [Which sources are used for the lists and how are the lists compiled on the basis of these sources?](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/wiki/FAQ#sources)

The results of a test against the 10000 [whotracks.me](https://whotracks.me/websites.html) pages. All pages were opened and fully loaded via batch in Edge with privacy features turned off. Cookies were all accepted.

Test them, give feedback and [report blockable or incorrectly blocked](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/issues) domains.

#### :octocat: Repository <a name="repository"></a>

The repository is occasionally compressed (reinitialised) to reduce the overall size. Among other things, this invalidates forks and cleans up the commit history.

#### :cyclone: Referral Domains <a name="referral"></a>

[Why are referral domains (affiliate and tracking links) not blocked in the lists?](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/wiki/FAQ#referral)

#### :dizzy: Support Me <a name="support"></a>

If you like the project and you can benefit from it, leave a :star: (top right) and become a [stargazer](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/stargazers)!

Give feedback, show me your ideas, report domains to be blocked, report false positive domains and help to keep the internet safe and clean.
Help and cooperation of any kind are welcome!

**Thanks for your support!**
